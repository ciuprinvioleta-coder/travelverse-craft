## 🌍 Introduction

Beyond the glittering Amalfi Coast and the famous villages of Cinque Terre, Italy hides quieter seaside gems where life moves to the rhythm of the tides. Along this journey from Liguria to Sardinia, you'll discover fishing hamlets perched on cliffs, beaches reached only by forest paths, and towns painted in sun-faded colors.

This is the authentic Mediterranean — intimate, flavorful, and endlessly photogenic.

## 🏖️ Highlights

### 1. Tellaro – Liguria's Secret Poet's Haven

Clinging to the cliffs east of Cinque Terre, Tellaro is a small pastel village where time seems to stand still. Its stone alleys wind down to a tiny harbor dominated by the pink Church of San Giorgio, perched dramatically above the sea. Writers like Mario Soldati once found refuge here — and it's easy to see why.

### 2. Marina di Pisciotta – The Soul of Cilento

In the heart of the Cilento Coast (southern Campania), Marina di Pisciotta remains deeply tied to its fishing traditions. The village is famous for menaica anchovies, salted by hand using centuries-old methods. Wander between olive groves, watch fishermen at work, and savor anchovy-based dishes in family-run trattorias by the sea.

### 3. Porto Selvaggio – Puglia's Hidden Natural Cove

A protected nature reserve on Puglia's Ionian coast, Porto Selvaggio rewards those willing to walk 20 minutes through pine forest with crystalline turquoise water. Bring sturdy shoes and a picnic — it's one of Italy's most peaceful swimming spots. The surrounding cliffs are dotted with caves and lookout towers from ancient times.

### 4. Maratea – The Pearl of the Tyrrhenian

Dramatically spread across hills and coves in Basilicata, Maratea feels untouched by mass tourism. Colorful houses cascade toward the sea, and the hilltop Cristo Redentore statue (taller than Rio's) offers a breathtaking panorama. The old town brims with small churches and artisan shops selling local ceramics.

### 5. Bosa – Sardinia's Riverside Gem

Set along the Temo River, Bosa is a riot of color and history. Its pastel houses climb up to Malaspina Castle, and its riverfront cafés offer the perfect view for sunset aperitivo. Just outside town, Bosa Marina features wide golden sands and calm waters, ideal for a swim after sightseeing.
