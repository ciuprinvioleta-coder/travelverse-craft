## üèîÔ∏è Introduction

The W-Trek in Torres del Paine National Park is one of the world's most spectacular multi-day hikes. Named for its "W" shaped route, this 80-kilometer (50-mile) trek showcases Patagonia's dramatic landscapes: towering granite peaks, electric blue glaciers, turquoise lakes, and windswept grasslands.

I completed the W-Trek in November 2023, hiking west to east over five incredible days. This guide shares everything you need to know to plan your own Patagonian adventure.

## üìã Trek Overview

### Basic Stats
- **Distance:** 80 km (50 miles)
- **Duration:** 4-5 days
- **Difficulty:** Moderate to challenging
- **Elevation gain:** Approximately 4,000 meters cumulative
- **Starting point:** Paine Grande (via catamaran from Pudeto)
- **Ending point:** Hotel Las Torres

### Trail Sections
1. **Grey Glacier:** Paine Grande to Refugio Grey (11 km, 4 hours)
2. **Valle Franc√©s:** Refugio Paine Grande to Refugio Los Cuernos (12 km, 5 hours)
3. **French Valley:** Side trek from Valle Franc√©s (9 km round trip, 4-5 hours)
4. **Los Cuernos to Chileno:** Continue to Refugio Chileno (12 km, 4 hours)
5. **Torres del Paine:** Sunrise hike to Base Torres viewpoint (9 km round trip, 4-5 hours)

## üéí Camping vs. Refugios

### Refugios (Mountain Lodges)
I opted for refugios and couldn't have been happier with the decision. After long days of hiking in Patagonian winds, having a warm bed, hot meals, and a chance to socialize with other trekkers was invaluable.

**Cost:** $150-200 per night including:
- Bunk bed in shared dorm (4-8 people)
- Breakfast and dinner (packed lunch available for purchase)
- Hot showers
- Charging stations

**Pros:**
- No need to carry heavy camping gear
- Guaranteed shelter regardless of weather
- Social atmosphere with other hikers
- Hot meals and showers

**Cons:**
- Significantly more expensive than camping
- Must book 6-9 months in advance for peak season
- Less flexibility in your itinerary

### Camping
**Cost:** $10-15 per night (campsite fee only)
- Bring your own tent and sleeping bag
- Purchase meals at refugio restaurants or cook your own
- Access to basic facilities

**My recommendation:** Refugios for comfort and convenience, camping if you're on a tight budget or booking last minute.

## üóìÔ∏è Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 0: Puerto Natales to Paine Grande
- Morning: 6:30 AM bus from Puerto Natales to Pudeto (2 hours)
- 12:30 PM catamaran to Paine Grande (30 minutes)
- Afternoon: Settle into Refugio Paine Grande, explore the area

**Pro tip:** Book the earliest catamaran time to have a relaxed first day and avoid feeling rushed.

### Day 1: Grey Glacier (11 km)
The trek begins with stunning views of the Grey Glacier. The trail follows the shore of Lago Grey with icebergs floating in the turquoise water.

**Highlights:**
- Multiple viewpoints overlooking Grey Glacier
- Icebergs on the lake shore (safe to touch!)
- Suspension bridges over rushing rivers

**Photography tip:** Golden hour at Grey Glacier is magical. The evening light illuminates the ice, creating an ethereal blue glow.

### Day 2: French Valley (21 km total)
The longest and most challenging day‚Äîbut absolutely worth it. Hike from Refugio Grey back to Paine Grande, then into the French Valley.

**Highlights:**
- Hanging glaciers on the Frances Valley walls
- 360-degree views of Los Cuernos peaks
- Avalanche sounds echoing through the valley

**Warning:** French Valley is exposed to Patagonia's notorious winds. I experienced 80+ km/h gusts that made hiking genuinely difficult. Bring windproof gear!

### Day 3: Los Cuernos (12 km)
A relatively easier day with spectacular scenery. The trail winds along Lago Nordenskj√∂ld with the Los Cuernos peaks dominating the skyline.

**Highlights:**
- Mirror reflections of Los Cuernos in the lake
- Guanaco sightings (Patagonian llama-like animals)
- Colorful rock formations

**Tip:** This is a great recovery day before the challenging Base Torres hike.

### Day 4: Base Torres Sunrise (18 km round trip)
The grand finale. Wake at 4:30 AM for the sunrise hike to the base of the famous Torres del Paine towers.

**The Experience:**
- 2-hour hike in darkness with headlamps
- Final hour is a steep boulder scramble
- Arriving at the viewpoint as sunrise illuminates the towers is indescribably beautiful

**Reality check:** This hike is tough. The boulder section requires scrambling, and at 5 AM with no sleep, it feels brutal. But when you see those towers light up pink and gold at sunrise, every step is worth it.

## üéí What to Pack

### Clothing (Layers are key!)
- **Base layers:** Merino wool (2 sets)
- **Mid layer:** Fleece or down jacket
- **Outer layer:** Waterproof, windproof jacket (ESSENTIAL)
- **Pants:** Hiking pants + rain pants
- **Hat & gloves:** Even in summer
- **Hiking boots:** Waterproof with good ankle support
- **Gaiters:** Helpful for stream crossings

### Gear
- **Trekking poles:** Crucial for stability in wind
- **Headlamp:** For pre-dawn Base Torres hike
- **Dry bags:** To keep gear dry in rain
- **Water bottles:** 2-3 liters capacity
- **Sunglasses & sunscreen:** Patagonian sun is intense
- **Camera:** Don't forget extra batteries (cold drains them fast)

### Optional but Recommended
- **Book or kindle:** For refugio downtime
- **Earplugs:** Dorm rooms can be noisy
- **Blister treatment:** Compeed or moleskin
- **Buff/neck gaiter:** Wind and sun protection

### What I Didn't Need
- More than two sets of clothes (you'll wear the same outfit anyway)
- Heavy camera gear (phone cameras work great)
- Sleeping bag (refugios provide bedding)

## üí∞ Budget Breakdown

### Accommodation (Refugios - 4 nights)
$700-800

### Meals
- **Refugio dinners & breakfasts:** Included
- **Packed lunches:** $15 x 4 = $60
- **Snacks & extras:** $40

### Transportation
- **Bus Puerto Natales to Torres del Paine:** $25 round trip
- **Catamaran to Paine Grande:** $35 one way
- **Return bus from Hotel Las Torres:** $20

### Park Entrance Fee
$40 (21,000 Chilean Pesos)

### Total: Approximately $900-1,000

**Budget option (camping):** $300-400 total if camping and self-catering

## üå¶Ô∏è Weather & What to Expect

### Weather Reality
Patagonia's weather is famously unpredictable. I experienced:
- Day 1: Sunshine and 18¬∞C
- Day 2: Rain, wind, and 8¬∞C
- Day 3: Partial clouds and 12¬∞C
- Day 4: Clear sunrise, then afternoon rain

**Pack for all conditions.** The phrase "four seasons in one day" is absolutely accurate.

### Wind
Patagonian winds are no joke. Gusts regularly exceed 60-80 km/h. I witnessed:
- Hikers being blown off balance
- Tent poles snapping at campsites
- Refugio doors being ripped open

**Wind protection is NON-NEGOTIABLE.**

## üì∏ Photography Tips

### Best Shots
1. **Grey Glacier icebergs:** Early morning light
2. **Los Cuernos reflection:** Calm mornings on Lago Nordenskj√∂ld
3. **Base Torres:** Sunrise illumination
4. **French Valley:** Wide-angle shots of the valley amphitheater

### Camera Settings
- **Sunrise/sunset:** Low ISO (100-400), tripod if possible
- **Landscapes:** F/8-F/11 for depth of field
- **Windy conditions:** Fast shutter speed (1/500s+) to avoid blur

**Phone photography:** Honestly, modern phone cameras capture stunning images. Don't feel pressured to carry heavy camera gear.

## üåü Practical Tips

### Booking
- **Book 6-9 months ahead** for December-February
- **Shoulder season** (Nov, March) offers better availability
- **Use Vertice Patagonia or Fantasy RV** for refugio bookings

### Training
I recommend:
- 3-4 months of hiking with a weighted backpack
- Stair climbing for elevation gain
- Core exercises for stability in wind

### Money
- Refugios are cashless (credit cards accepted)
- Bring cash for Puerto Natales expenses
- Chilean Pesos preferred, USD accepted at poor rates

## ü¶ô Wildlife Encounters

I spotted:
- **Guanacos:** Daily sightings, especially in Valle Franc√©s
- **Andean Condors:** Soaring above Los Cuernos
- **Foxes:** Near campsites at dusk
- **Flamingos:** At Lago Nordenskj√∂ld

**Important:** Keep a safe distance from wildlife and never feed animals.

## üá®üá± Puerto Natales Base Camp

Most trekkers base themselves in Puerto Natales before and after the trek.

**Where to stay:**
- **Erratic Rock Hostel:** Legendary hostel with excellent trail briefings ($25-30/night)
- **Hostel Natalino:** Modern and clean ($30-40/night)

**Where to eat:**
- **Aldea Restaurant:** Best king crab in town
- **Last Hope Distillery:** Craft beer and burgers
- **Mama Rosa:** Empanadas to go

## üéØ Final Thoughts & Advice

**Is it hard?** Yes. Expect fatigue, sore muscles, and weather challenges.
